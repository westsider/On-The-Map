#On-The-Map
#Project Overview
This app was written in Xcode 8 for Swift 3 with a map that shows information posted by other students at Udacity. The map contains pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.

#Why this project?
This project gave me an opportunity to post and retrieve data from a network resource using Apple’s networking framework. It also allowed me to authenticate a user thought the Udacity Api and also Facebook.

#What did I learn?
Accessing networked data using Apple’s URL loading framework
Authenticating a user using over a network connection
Creating user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
Use Core Location and the MapKit framework for to display annotated pins on a map
Why is this project meaningful to my career?
Working with data from networked sources is as important to iOS development as creating good user interfaces. Completing this project shows that I can both read and write from RESTful networked APIs.

#Extra features 
Facebook Login, Circle activity indicator during login and geocoding, Disable and fade UI during login and geocoding, Url Scrubbing: check incomming Url - remove blank spaces and add missing http, Check outgoing Url for proper formatting.
